OnCtlColor is MFC's way in handling the coloring of the controls and dialog when they are needed to be repainted. This functions is automatically called by the system or rather by the MFC internals to ask us what should be the control's color. We don't call this function directly.
To let MFC know that we want to use this function, go to the Wizard Dialog (CTRL + W). In the Classname and Object ID, select your dialog's class. In the Messages, double-click the WM_CTLCOLOR. It will add OnCtlColor in the Member Functions. Add the code that Kivju gave you and that's it. Run the program and you can see that the text is in red.

ATTENTION: includer la version 10 (visual studio) de tbb!! (vc10) VERSION 32BIT!!

The normals matrix should be the inverse of the transpose of the modelview matrix, i.e.
nMatrix = mat4_inverse(mat4_transpose(mvMatrix));

problems: glm website often unavailable in china, even with proxy. 
no doc!!  had to rewrite functions, helped me understand the math

careful,did not take care of the case of isolated vertices!!
the problem is, some files are quads and the prog does not work on these files -.-

prob with lloyd clustering:
the centroid does not correspond to an existing data point; therefor the SGF and shape index don't exist for these clusters
either: re compute all the SGF and shape index  (so basically recompute everything)
or find data point closest to centroid (not reliable)/makes no sense

to recompute everything, we need not the centroids, but the groups of points
(currently lloyd returns an array with coordinates of centroids and size of their group
